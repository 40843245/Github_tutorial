The option_list can contain

(1.2)--body <CONTENT> which refers the content of the issue as <CONTENT>.

NOTE:
If --title <TITLE-NAME> is NOT specified, the terminal will ask you <TITLE-NAME>.
If --body <CONTENT> is NOT specified, the terminal will ask you <CONTENT>.

If either --title <TITLE-NAME> or --body <CONTENT> or both is NOT speficied, 
the terminal will ask you what's next after asking the information (after asking <TITLE-NAME> and <CONTENT>).

  with the information you just type. Instead of create a new issue in terminal.

  (1.3.2)In this request, you can also select "Continue" to create a new issue in terminal.

NOTE:
If --title <TITLE-NAME> and --body <CONTENT> are both specified, 
the issue will be created in terminal.
